                I'm a DevOps Engineer with strong fundamentals in cloud infrastructure, automation, 
                and continuous delivery. My approach centers on project-based learning and hands-on 
                implementation, building practical solutions that solve real-world problems.

                Through focused practice and experimentation, I've developed expertise in Linux system 
                administration, AWS cloud services, containerization with Docker and Kubernetes, 
                infrastructure as code using Terraform, and building robust CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins. 
                I believe in learning by doing — every project is an opportunity to deepen understanding 
                and refine best practices.

                My toolkit includes Linux, AWS (EC2, VPC, S3, RDS, Lambda, and more), Docker, Kubernetes, 
                Terraform, Git, Jenkins, and monitoring solutions like Datadog. I'm passionate about 
                automation, scalability, and creating infrastructure that empowers development teams to 
                ship faster and more reliably.
