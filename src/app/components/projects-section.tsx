  {
    title: "Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline",
    problem: "Manual build, test, and deployment processes caused delays and increased the risk of human error.",
    architecture: "Built Jenkins pipelines with stages for code checkout, build (Maven), code quality analysis (SonarQube), Docker image creation, and deployment. Implemented blue-green, canary, and rolling deployment strategies for different applications.",
    tools: ["Jenkins", "Maven", "SonarQube", "Docker", "Git", "Deployment Strategies"],
    outcome: "Automated entire software delivery pipeline, reduced deployment time from 2 hours to 15 minutes, and caught code quality issues early.",
    github: "#"
  },
  {
    title: "Monitoring & Alerting with Datadog",
    problem: "Lack of visibility into application performance and infrastructure health led to reactive problem-solving.",
    architecture: "Integrated Datadog agents across infrastructure for metric collection. Created custom dashboards for application performance, infrastructure health, and business KPIs. Set up intelligent alerts with proper thresholds and notification channels.",
